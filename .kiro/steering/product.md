# Product Overview

## Product Overview
Kiro-style Spec-Driven Development Framework for Claude Code - a comprehensive system that implements structured, phase-gated development workflows using Claude Code hooks and custom slash commands.

## Core Features
- **3-Phase Approval Workflow**: Enforced progression through Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation phases
- **Steering Documents**: Persistent project knowledge through markdown-based context files
- **Custom Slash Commands**: Pre-built commands for each development phase (`/spec-init`, `/spec-requirements`, etc.)
- **Automated Progress Tracking**: Task completion monitoring and specification compliance checking
- **Context Preservation**: Steering documents maintain project knowledge across all AI interactions
- **Human-in-the-Loop Approval**: Explicit approval gates prevent premature phase progression
- **Specification Management**: Structured directories and metadata tracking for each feature specification

## Target Use Case
- **Primary**: Software development teams implementing spec-driven development with Claude Code
- **Secondary**: Individual developers seeking structured approaches to AI-assisted development
- **Specific Scenarios**:
  - New feature development requiring formal specification and approval workflows
  - Complex projects needing consistent AI context and decision-making patterns
  - Teams requiring documentation-driven development with quality gates
  - Projects where requirements, design, and implementation phases need clear separation

## Key Value Proposition
- **Structured Development**: Eliminates ad-hoc AI interactions through systematic phase-gated workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Human approval gates ensure specifications meet requirements before implementation
- **Consistency**: Steering documents provide persistent context, ensuring all AI interactions align with project standards
- **Transparency**: Clear progress tracking and specification status visibility
- **Scalability**: Reusable framework applicable across multiple projects and teams
- **Integration**: Native Claude Code integration through hooks and slash commands
- **Knowledge Retention**: Project context and decisions are preserved in versioned markdown files
